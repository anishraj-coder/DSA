            /*Excellent question! This condition is a key optimization 
             * in the prime-checking algorithm.
             *  Let's break it down:

```java
if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0)
    return false;
```

This condition is used within the loop that starts with `i = 5` and increments `i`
 by 6 in each iteration (`i += 6`).
 Here's why it's used:

1. Pattern of Prime Numbers:
   After eliminating multiples of 2 and 3, all prime numbers follow the pattern 6k Â± 1,
    where k is a positive integer. 
   This means prime numbers (except 2 and 3) can only be of the form 6k - 1 or 6k + 1.

2. Checking Two Numbers at Once:
   - `i` represents numbers of the form 6k - 1
   - `i + 2` represents numbers of the form 6k + 1

3. Efficiency:
   By checking both `i` and `i + 2` in a single iteration, we cover all potential prime
    factors without
    checking numbers that are definitely not prime (like 6k, 6k + 2, 6k + 3, 6k + 4).

4. Example:
   When i = 5:
   - We check if n is divisible by 5 (6 * 1 - 1)
   - We also check if n is divisible by 7 (6 * 1 + 1)
   
   Next iteration, i = 11:
   - We check if n is divisible by 11 (6 * 2 - 1)
   - We also check if n is divisible by 13 (6 * 2 + 1)

   And so on...
